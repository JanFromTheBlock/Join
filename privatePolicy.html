        <h2>Collection of General Information When Visiting Our Website</h2>
        <h3>Nature and Purpose of Processing:</h3>
        <p>When you access our website without registering or otherwise transmitting information, general information of
            a
            non-personal nature is automatically recorded. This information (server log files) includes, for example,
            the type of
            web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your IP address,
            and the
            like.</p>
        <p>They are processed in particular for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring a seamless connection to the website,</li>
            <li>Ensuring smooth use of our website,</li>
            <li>Evaluating the security and stability of the systems, and</li>
            <li>Optimizing our website.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use this data to draw conclusions about you personally. This information is statistically evaluated
            by us, if
            necessary, in order to optimize our Internet presence and the underlying technology.</p>
        <h3>Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest:</h3>
        <p>Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR on the basis of our legitimate
            interest in
            improving the stability and functionality of our website.</p>
        <h3>Recipients:</h3>
        <p>Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who work as order processors for the operation and

        <p>The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection. For data
            collected to
            provide the website, this is generally the case when the respective session has ended.</p>
        <p>In the case of data stored in log files, this is the case after a maximum of 14 days. Further storage is
            possible. In
            this case, the IP addresses of the users are anonymized so that an assignment of the calling client is no
            longer
            possible.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Provision Required or Obligatory:</h3>
        <p>The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually required. Without the
            IP address,
            however, the service and functionality of our website are not guaranteed. Additionally, individual services
            and features
            may not be available or may be restricted. Therefore, an objection is excluded.</p>
